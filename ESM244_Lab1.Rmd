```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

### Read in SF trees data

```{r}
sf_trees <- read_csv(here("data", "sf_trees", "sf_trees.csv"))
```

### Basic wrangling reminders

Refresh skills for data wrangling and summary statistics using functions in the 'dplyr' package.

Find the top 5 highest observations of trees by legal_status, do some wrangling, make a graph.

```{r}
top_5_status <- sf_trees %>% 
  count(legal_status) %>% 
    # acts as group_by() + n() + summarise() functions
    # can include multiple variables to group by
  drop_na(legal_status) %>% 
  rename(tree_count = n) %>% 
    # new name goes on left, old name on right
  relocate(tree_count) %>% 
    # move columns to various positions
  slice_max(tree_count, n = 5)
    # arranges by count and picks top 5 (better than arrange/head)
```
